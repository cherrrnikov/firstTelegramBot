# firstTelegramBot
Very simple Telegram bot created with Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring JPA, MySQL.
Most of the functionality has not been implemented, because the project was aimed at studying the main commands when working with bots. After studying it, I will be able to implement a full-fledged bot.
It was not uploaded to the remote server, because it requires hosting payment, but you can evaluate the structure of the code :)
